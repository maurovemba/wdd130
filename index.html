                <p>Hey! My name is Mauro Vemba, I am from Angola and I am someone who wants to know how to code because
                        it is actually one of my passions, I can say. Since a little child, I had a strong interest
                        about games and things like that, therefore, I asked myself "how does this thing works?" I am
                        sure that with effort, I can become a good programmer.</p>
